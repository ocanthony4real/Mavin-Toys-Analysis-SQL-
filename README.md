# Mavin-Toys-Analysis-SQL-
This is a performance analysis on a fictional toy sales company. The data was gotten from https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?tags=57i7XlW6LkVTbF7n5UYhhS&tags=5MSssPPte7oIgmiVUc3bYZ&tags=10btmr8wmkqkEgJMfgtOv2&tags=6VsYP6u8mKTdSdQymNjGYR

I cleaned the data thoroughly using MySQL. You can find the script in the file attached to this repository. Therafter imported the data into PowerBI where I further explored the data and created a dashboard.
